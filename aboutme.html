    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Erin Song. I am a technology and education consultant. I have a BS in Education, studied towards MS in Education.  In the past, I've worked as a corporate communications consultant, an education consultant to a teaching specialist.  As an observant educator-learner, I couldn't help but notice the rapidly growing importance of technology in daily living and how crucial it is to acquire the skills and understanding to become a responsible learner for the future.  This epiphany, awakening, in turn started 2018, I applied to Bertelsmann Data Science Challenge scholarship and accepted into the challenge scholarship Phase I and, again, Phase II, I was top 10 % who earned Data Foundation Nanodegree via Udacity and last year I earned another scholarship via Facebook, Secure & Private AI which allowed me to learn and create an education tool called MineTorch, a Deep Learning Programming platform for kids by building GUI, Block programming wrapper, NN Creation API and PyTorch with my team.  My team and I applied and competed for Global PyTorch Summer Hackathon 2019 and won Third place at Facebook, Menlo Park. In addition, I am an event organizer for OpenMind, Raleigh Triangle Park.  When my son was in elementary school I volunteered at Coding Club to help children to learn to code using Scratch.<br /> </p><p id="secondparagraph">I didn't go to school for computer science or Information Technology but studied education as I mentioned earlier.  After graduation, I taught English overseas in Korea to elementary students in a private school, returned home to North Carolina taught English to the international engineers at Cisco in Raleigh Triangle Park, North Carolina. Then after I started a family, now I am a mom to a beautiful boy who loves to read and also loves to play video games online from Minecraft to fortnite ... etc. with his friends wearing a headphone communicating virtually.  I consider myself a late tech-bloomer -- an admirer of technology, developers, engineers, and decision makers as they are like wizards making our wishes come true -- who felt the importance and the impact in our daily life as I watch my child grow up, especially, this year going to school online from the pandemic to playing video games with his friends, our deep interdependence on it, I think having a child can spark a wonder - you cannot help but care, pay attention to our surroundings and keep a watchful eye for the future.  I had a moment that I must educate myself with technology to help and support my child which was really a turning point in my life.  I am keenly aware of the fast change of technology; personal and communal need to respond to this challenge through open-mindedness, curiosity, flexibility, learning, unlearning and making change. I want to make a career out of this very need and be part of the solution, a confident creator, a fearless innovator.  I am an advocate to bridge the growing gap between the tech communities to the non-tech communities. Check out my<a href="Erin Song.pdf"> resume!</a>
